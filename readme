Hi All,

We are using AWS Transfer Family and we need to write a code using Python in AWS Lambda using boto3. Below are the requirements:-

1. Ability to transfer files to folders under different bucket for a single user.
2. Ability to transfer files to folders under same bucket for a single user.

Example :- Weekly report when pushed then it needs to transfer to weekly folder and when monthly report pushed then it needs to be transfer to monthly folder.

The file needs to be transferred to S3 bucket with respective username and then the files needs to be moved according to the report.

Please let me know if any more details are required.
